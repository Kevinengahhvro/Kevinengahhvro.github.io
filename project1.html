    <h1>Year 10 Work experience at USYD's School of Aerospace Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      During Year 10 I found out that there was an international publishing program for papers made by young students!
      Severely interested by this I decided to look for ideas that I could do, the idea i was working on was the physcological implications of in-game lootboxes.
      I quickly got bored of the idea, and found inspiration in wind tunnels. With this new profound inspiration, I wanted to write a paper on which car spoilers
      help the car to reduce lift and drag on cars. Cold emailing a professor at USYD (Ben Thornber) I was told that before doing 
      wind tunnel testing for the models, it would be best to do run them through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) first. I was also
      told that CFD is more of a 2nd year of Aeronautical Engineer thing to learn.
